# UBC Blockchain Developer Workshops
  
## Homework 4
Congratulations on completing the fourth (online) session of the course!

This week we're partnering with [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com) for the homework assignment. You're going to build a full-stack "Buy me a coffee" application on the blockchain, and have the opportunity to tie in your React.js knowledge with your Solidity knowledge.

Follow the below video (1.5hr long), push your code to Github and submit the repo link along with your name/wallet for a snazzy NFT this week:
