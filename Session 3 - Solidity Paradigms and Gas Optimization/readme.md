# UBC Blockchain Developer Workshops

## Homework 3

Congratulations on completing the third sesion of the course!

This homework set is **extremely important**. You wil be solidifying your blockchain development skills and giving yourself a base to learn [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), which is a frontend library enabling you to create user applications that can interact with you smart contracts. React is one of the most highly sought-after skills in software engineering, so this is defintely worth spending time on.

This homework will take anywhere from < 1 hour - 5 hours to complete depending on how much you'd like to practice/what your current skill level is.

### Review of today's course material:

- What is the use of a requires clause?
- If I have a function in class B which overrides another function in a parent class A, which function will be operated on?
- Why do we need to optimize our smart contracts to be gas efficient?
- Why use a mapping instead of an array and what are the key differences?
